<!--
  TODO: For now, we strip all of the non-heading content (before generating the ToC) with something like this:
    grep '^## ' CHANGELOG.md
  Once this bug is fixed, we would no longer need to do that:
    https://github.com/derlin/bitdowntoc/issues/26
  Alternately, once the following bugfix PR is merged, we could go back to using MarkdownTOC to do it automatically:
    https://github.com/naokazuterada/MarkdownTOC/pull/170

<!-- TOC start (generated with https://derlin.github.io/bitdowntoc/) -->
<!-- TOC end -->

<!-- TODO: Reinstate this after this bug is fixed: https://github.com/naokazuterada/MarkdownTOC/pull/170 -->
